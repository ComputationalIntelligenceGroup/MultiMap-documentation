#### Requeriments

For proper functioning of MultiMap and all extensions it is no longer necessary to install nodejs and npm.

To ensure it is correctly  installed just open new terminal or command prompt and type ```node -v``` and ```npm -v```. This will show the version of them. Futhermore, yo can create new test program in Javascript, and run it using  ```node test.js```.

- The latest version of [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) for ImageJExtension.

 	- Windows: Download and Install .exe file.

 	- LINUX: ```sudo apt install default-jre```
