### First use

The first time MultiMap is started (on Windows it should start automatically after the installation) the application has no extension installed and it will automatically start the installation process of MapExtension, ImageJExtension (and DevExt).

When the extensions will be installed and loaded the waiting alerts will disappear.

Now MultiMap is ready to be used, but still you can't see any extensions, that's because you have to activate them the first time.

Just click over `MapExtension` and `ImageJExtension` in the `Extensions` menu to activate them.

##### Install ImageJ
If ImageJExtension is not able to find a valid ImageJ installation it will ask you to fix the problem, the easiest way is by clicking `Quick auto-install` in the message displayed.

You are now ready to load a first map or to create your own.
