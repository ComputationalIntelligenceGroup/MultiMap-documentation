### Extensions

MultiMap is a modular tool which can be expanded through diferent extensions. It uses [electrongui](https://github.com/gherardovarando/electrongui) framework to develop them.


Extensions already present:

- [mapextension](http://github.com/gherardovarando/mapextension): creating and viewing Maps.

- [imagejextension](http://github.com/gherardovarando/imagejextension): processing images and extraction of parameters and objects.

- [GraphicsMagickExtension](https://github.com/gherardovarando/GraphicsMagickExtension): collection of tools and libraries which support reading, writing, and manipulating an image.

- [BioFormatsExtension](https://github.com/gherardovarando/bioformatsextension)

To install extensions there are two ways:
