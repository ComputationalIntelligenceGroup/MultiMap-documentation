ISSUES LINUX,,
"- Sometimes at the moment of drawing an element it gets stuck, drawing infinite polygons and it is necessary to press the ""cancel"" button. Then, when selecting an item, it is not visible on the map. An attempt was made to select and deselect the Drawnitems layer without success. It is not solved by reloading the map or restarting the program.",,
